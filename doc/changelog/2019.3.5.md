# Progress Log March 5th, 2019

So far I have been working on coefficient generators. And currently there has been lots of problems with the program.

I'm only testing on environment map coefficient generators for now, and almost all of the papers I've been looking at has their own representations of the computation steps. I'm going to address the problems I've encountered:

## Precomputing Step

If we are to precompute the coefficients, we are going to store the coefficients for RED, GREEN, and BLUE channels separately. Regardless of this, we have two ways of calculating the coefficients from environment maps:

### 1. Use sampling method

We create fixed amount of samples. For example, `SAMPLE_COUNT` many. These samples should be distributing uniformly across the whole sphere, which has `4 * PI` area in total. So each sample will occupy a certain area of `4 * PI / SAMPLE_COUNT`. Before doing the normalization, we want to accumulate the value

### 2. When using a single environment map

When using a single environment map, we need to notice that the metric is not uniform across the whole image. As you are close to the upper or lower boundary, the significance of the pixel gets smaller. Let `\theta \in (0, \pi)` denote the vertical angle, you will need to add `\sin(\theta)` to be the pixel weight. Note that when you are doing the integral `\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \sin(\theta) d\theta d\phi` you will get `4\pi` which is the total surface area of the unit sphere.
